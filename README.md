In order to run the script you need to install the following libraries:

:question: HOW TO USE IT:

Before proceeding, if you want to use a local file, make sure that the file that you want to format is in the "local input files" folder.

Download the zip and extract the folder.

Once you have installed all the needed libraries (along with the ChromeDriver), just open the terminal in that folder and run the following command:  `python bibtex-google-scholar-formatting.py`
